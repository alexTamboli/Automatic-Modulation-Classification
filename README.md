# AMC--Project
An efficient neural network techniques based on depthwise separable convolution has been proposed to classify the modulation of the received signals.
</br>
Automatic modulation classifier implemented using differnet deep learning techniques.
</br>
Analysis of different techniques is shown.
</br>
Model implementation code partially taken from <a href="https://github.com/pkhorram"> a github user </a>.
